Operationalizing a Coworking Space Microservice

Project Overview: Coworking Space Service
The Coworking Space Service is a set of APIs that enables users to request one-time tokens and administrators to authorize access to a coworking space.

This service follows a microservice pattern and the APIs are split into distinct services that can be deployed and managed independently of one another.
